        <p>
          I am an investor with &gt;15 years of professional experience just trying to figure stuff out.
          To that end, I occasionally send out lists of stuff I find interesting and very occasionally write
          something long form, under a nom de plume,&nbsp;

          Hamilton Helmer&apos;s writing has heavily influenced my perspective on analyzing businesses. I strongly
          recommend his book,&nbsp;

          &nbsp;and his interviews on Acquired (see&nbsp;

          HelmerBot was vibe coded with GPT in VS Code, uses Claude to create and maintain the company database,
          and uses GPT-5 to do the heavy lifting on the analysis. The web design was done by GPT-5 using prompts
          referencing the &quot;Bloomberg chillwave&quot; aesthetic.

        <p>
          It&apos;s worth mentioning that this was built for pure amusement and I have no affiliation whatsoever
          with Helmer or Strategy Capital.
